# DASC500-Dissertation---Inequalities-in-Childhood-Pneumococcal-Vaccine-Uptake-in-England
This repository contains the code, data processing, and analysis for my MSc Health Data Science dissertation:  "Examining trends and inequalities in childhood pneumococcal vaccine uptake in England: schedule changes and implications for protection amongst childhood cohorts."

## ðŸŒ¸ Aims

ðŸ«§ Investigate trends and inequalities in uptake of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) across two immunisation schedules:

  - 2+1 schedule: 8, 16 weeks + booster at 12 months (pre-2020).
  
  - 1+1 schedule: 12 weeks + booster at 12 months (post-2020).

ðŸ«§ Estimate and compare disease susceptibility between childhood cohorts under the two schedules by combining vaccine uptake data with published vaccine effectiveness evidence.

## ðŸŒ¸ Data Sources

ðŸ«§ UKHSA COVER Programme â€“ Cover of Vaccination Evaluated Rapidly (uptake data).

ðŸ«§ ONS Population Estimates â€“ demographic and population data.

ðŸ«§ Published Literature â€“ vaccine effectiveness studies and systematic reviews.

## ðŸŒ¸ Methods

ðŸ«§ Descriptive analysis and statistical modelling of PCV uptake.

ðŸ«§ Integration of vaccine effectiveness estimates with uptake trends to assess susceptibility.

ðŸ«§ Inequality analysis â€“ exploring variation by geography and deprivation.

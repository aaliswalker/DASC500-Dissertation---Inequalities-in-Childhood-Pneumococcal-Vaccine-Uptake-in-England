## 🌸 Aims

🫧 Investigate trends and inequalities in uptake of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) across two immunisation schedules:

  - 2+1 schedule: 8, 16 weeks + booster at 12 months (pre-2020).
  
  - 1+1 schedule: 12 weeks + booster at 12 months (post-2020).

🫧 Estimate and compare disease susceptibility between childhood cohorts under the two schedules by combining vaccine uptake data with published vaccine effectiveness evidence.

## 🌸 Data Sources

🫧 UKHSA COVER Programme – Cover of Vaccination Evaluated Rapidly (uptake data).

🫧 ONS Population Estimates – demographic and population data.

🫧 Published Literature – vaccine effectiveness studies and systematic reviews.

## 🌸 Methods

🫧 Descriptive analysis and statistical modelling of PCV uptake.

🫧 Integration of vaccine effectiveness estimates with uptake trends to assess susceptibility.

🫧 Inequality analysis – exploring variation by geography and deprivation.

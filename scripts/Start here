## ðŸŒ¸ Scripts

The repository contains several R scripts, each labelled according to its role in the workflow:

ðŸ«§ Stage1.R â€“ Data wrangling and preprocessing, including renaming columns, extracting and joining into long form. 

ðŸ«§ stage2.R â€“ Harmonising COVER and IMD datasets, and preparing them for analysis.

ðŸ«§ stage3.R â€“ Initial descriptive analysis of vaccine uptake trends across years and cohorts (2+1 vs 1+1 schedule). Inequalities analysis, examining uptake by deprivation (IMD quintiles), geography, and other stratifiers.
 Estimating disease susceptibility by combining uptake with published vaccine effectiveness data.

ðŸ«§ Stage4.R â€“ Scripts for generating geographic visualisations (maps of vaccine uptake and susceptibility by local authority).

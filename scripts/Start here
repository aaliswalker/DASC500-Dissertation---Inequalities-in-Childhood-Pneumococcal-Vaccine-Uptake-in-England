## ðŸŒ¸ Scripts

The repository contains several R scripts, each labelled according to its role in the workflow:

ðŸ«§ cleaning.R â€“ Data wrangling and preprocessing, including renaming columns, harmonising COVER and IMD datasets, and preparing them for analysis.

ðŸ«§ stage1.R â€“ Initial descriptive analysis of vaccine uptake trends across years and cohorts (2+1 vs 1+1 schedule).

ðŸ«§ stage2.R â€“ Inequalities analysis, examining uptake by deprivation (IMD quintiles), geography, and other stratifiers.

ðŸ«§ stage3.R â€“ Estimating disease susceptibility by combining uptake with published vaccine effectiveness data.

ðŸ«§ geo_graphs.R â€“ Scripts for generating geographic visualisations (maps of vaccine uptake and inequalities by local authority).
